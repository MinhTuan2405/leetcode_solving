# Problem 1
[Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/description/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

*Constraints:*
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
```

## Approach
### Pseudo
```
function levelOrder(root)
    if root is NULL
        return an empty list

    initialize v as an empty list of lists
    initialize q as an empty queue
    enqueue root into q

    while q is not empty
        t = size of q
        initialize a as an empty list

        for i from 0 to t - 1
            node = front element of q
            dequeue q
            append value of node to a

            if node has a left child
                enqueue left child of node into q

            if node has a right child
                enqueue right child of node into q

        append a to v

    return v

```
### Code
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}

    vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == NULL) return {};
        vector <vector <int>> v;
        std::queue <TreeNode*> q;
        q.push (root);
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int t = q.size ();
            vector <int> a;
            for (int i = 0; i < t; ++i) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front ();
                q.pop ();
                a.push_back (node -> val);
                if (node -> left) q.push (node -> left);
                if (node -> right) q.push (node -> right);
            }
            v.push_back (a);

        return v;
    }

# Problem 2
[Number Of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/)

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume 
all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

*Example 1:*
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```
*Example 2:*
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
 ```

*Constraints:*
```
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
```
